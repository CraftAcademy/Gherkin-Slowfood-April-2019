Feature:  Visitor can see different products on a restaurants menu 
    As a visitor,
    In order to get an overview of the restaurant products
    I would like to be able to see a menu

    Background:
        Given the following products exist
            | name         | description                       | price  |
            | Hamburger    | Juicy, great meat to bun ratio!   | 199    |
            | Cheeseburger | Almost as juicy, very tasty!      | 229    |

    Scenario: Visitor can view products on the landing page
        When I visit the landing page
        Then I should see "Hamburger"
        And I should see "Juicy, great meat to bun ratio!"
        And I should see 199
        And I should see "Cheeseburger"
        And I should see "Almost as juicy, very tasty!"
        And I should see 229
